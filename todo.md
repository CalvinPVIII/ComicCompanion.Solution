### Client:

- Overall styling cleanup
- Adjust navmenu. Use form/formcontrol??
- Handle auth tokens (kind of done? security audit maybe)
- Creating reading lists
- ~~Making searching comics feel more "reactive"~~
- hide .env
- ComicInfo loading styling (skeleton)
- ~~Number on currently editing reading list in top left~~
- Prevent adding dupes to reading list??

#### Would be nice:

- Extracting adding/deleting issue to currently edited reading list to reusable function

### API:

- Replace RCO source (https://xoxocomic.com/)
- Rewrite tests
- Popular comics endpoint
- Add number of pages info to comic endpoint
- Serialize the Issues Array in the ReadingListModel to be strings

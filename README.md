# Comic Companion

Comic Companion is an app for users to read the latest and classic comic books. Whether it's the original Detective Comics from 1937, or the latest weekly pulls, Comic Companion will have just what your looking for. In addition, Comic Companion also offers the user the ability to create and share reading lists? Ever wanted to read the definitive Spider-Man stories but didn't know where to start? Or maybe you wanted to start at the very beginning and read every Batman comic released in chronological order? Rather than going through the hassle of figuring out what you need to read and in what order, users can create and share reading lists, making finding exactly what you want to read a breeze.

**Comic Companion is currently under development, with a beta for web and android expected to launch soon**
